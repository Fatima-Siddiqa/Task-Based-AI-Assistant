# Smart AI Assistant

This is a unified task-routing AI assistant built using **Streamlit** and powered by the **`phi` model running locally with Ollama**. It supports three intelligent task modes:

- **Q&A**
- **Summarization**
- **Roleplay** (Doctor, Lawyer, Customer Support Agent)

All tasks are routed dynamically with appropriate prompting under the hood. The app features a sleek UI and intelligent input management.
